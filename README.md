Machine Learing model that predicts fraudulent transactions given historical transaction data

## Case Study:
Consider a firm that enables users to purchase content through a range of payment options known as payment channels. These channels include direct carrier billing, e-wallets, credit and debit cards, among others. Unfortunately, each of these channels is vulnerable to fraudulent activities, such as stolen credit cards, phishing for one-time passwords, and unauthorized use of e-wallets by family members.

Fraudulent activities can result in revenue loss and damage to the firm's reputation. Therefore, it's crucial to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. To achieve this, I consider historical transaction data that includes _flags_ indicating which transactions have been reported as _fraudulent_ by users of the payment service.

I develop a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a transaction is likely to be a fraud.
